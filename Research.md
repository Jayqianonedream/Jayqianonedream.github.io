## An EasyConnect System for Real-time Stress Monitoring between Caregivers and their Children in Daily Life through a Transformer-based Computation Model

May 2021 - Present

* Designed an EasyConnect Stress Tracking system, including an e-survey to record stressors of caregivers and their children, an “EasyConnect” Android app for caregivers to fill the e-survey, two Empatica E4 sensors for physiological data collection, and two HIPPA-compliant online servers to store data.

* Led and managed an at-home human subject study, validated its feasibility, and conducted usability tests to evaluate user experiences associated with the sensor and “EasyConnect” app.

* PPG and GSR signal processing, and extracted statistical features on different domains and automatic features through a proposed CNN-based autoencoder (PyTorch).

* Developed statistical models (ANOVA) and Machine Learning classification models (e.g., KNN, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest) to differentiate stress from non-stress using statistical and automatic features.

* Pioneered an LSTM-based Transformer (PyTorch) framework for automatic and real-time stress monitoring for children with ASD and their caregivers in real-life settings.

## A Virtual Reality System to Estimate Users’ Task Performance Using A Temporal Sequence Model through Non-verbal Behaviors

Sep 2018 - Present

* Designed an innovative 3D VR-based classroom interface with multi-sensory stimuli in Unity, managed and administrated human subject experiments, and conducted usability tests.

* Developed programs to capture users’ eye gaze, hand operations, and performance metrics.

* Visualized and analyzed data, and applied statistical models (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) for hypothesis testing regarding behavior patterns.

* Contributed to the innovative “Deep Temporal Sets with Evidential Reinforced Attentions” for identifying signature behavioral patterns of users (~95%) in response to multimodal dynamic sensory stimuli.

* Utilized ML models (e.g., SVM, NN) to classify users (96.2%) given proposed behavioral features.

* Designed and validated the LSTM-based temporal sequence modeling framework (TensorFlow/Keras) outperformed the “Encoder-Decoder” and “Transformer” for predicting users’ future task performance based on eye gazes and hand operations (RMSE: 0.021).

* Currently upgrading the interface into an adaptive learning/education system using RL through Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).

- Developed the NN-based regression framework to automatically analyze and quantify real-time non-verbal behavioral patterns to reflect interaction intensity (positive or negative).

- Proposed the “Condition-Induced Transfer Learning” framework to improve after-alcohol interaction intensity estimations for couples (an increase of 32%).

## A Computation Model to Estimate Interaction Intensity through Non-verbal Behavioral Cues in Couples

May 2021 - Sep 2021

- Conducted dataset preprocessing, including coloring behaviors for children, interaction behaviors for cohabiting couples, and Tai Chi movements for seniors.

- Designed and configured different architectures of LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (TensorFlow/Keras), such as one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many, and optimized parameters of all architectures through grid search for all datasets.

- Implemented statistical models (T-Test) to compare the performances of LSTM and GRU models, validating that the GRU model significantly outperformed the LSTM model in behavior forecasts.
