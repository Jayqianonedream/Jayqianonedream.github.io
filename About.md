As a Ph.D. in engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, I leverage 4.5+ years of statistical modeling and Machine/Deep/Reinforcement Learning (ML, DL, RL) knowledge to answer data-driven research questions. I am passionate about Human-AI Interaction, MobileHCI, human behavior cognitive modeling, and time-series behavior analysis. I am highly proficient in coding languages such as Python and Java to offer AI solutions by designing impactful models to support data-driven research.

Currently, I am a Machine Learning Researcher (full-time) at Sign-Speak, focusing on sign language recognition and translation to text/speech, and vice versa. In addition, I am also an affiliated researcher (freelance) at the University of Notre Dame, continuing my research in Human-AI Interaction.
